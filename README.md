# Doing Data Science at [MEST](http://www.meltwater.org)


The main goal of this course is to introduce students to data science techniques that allows them to produce production-level data products that solve problems. What this means is that we will aim to incorporate and deploy our data products into a web or mobile application for users to interact with. I hope at the end of this course, students will be able to apply core data science principles to build data-driven products and organizations.


This is an introductory Data Science course that is mainly based on the structure of [Doing Data Science book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028529.do) by Rachel Schutt and Cathy O'Neil. This course is intended for anyone interested in learning more about the data science process and applying it to their everyday projects or business solutions.

## Prerequisites

Students interested in taking this course should be comfortable experimenting with new ideas. A basic familiarity in using a Unix/Linux command line

## Data Science Toolbox

Mastering the Data Science process requires having a set of basic tools to process your data, test your hypothesis and extract meaning for insights.  For this course, we will show examples using several tools mainly from R and Python. Students should choose either of the tool sets and master them or feel free to use any combination as it suits them. The ball is in your court. See below for the tool set for this course:

| Tools                             | Python                    | R                                                                         |
